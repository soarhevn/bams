<h2>Double Entry Accounting</h2>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Debit means left. </li>
  <li>Credit means right. </li>
  <li>Every transaction affects two accounts or more. </li>
  <li>At least one account will be debited and at least one account will be credited. </li>
  <li>The total of the amount(s) entered as debits must equal the total of the amount(s)
    entered as credits. </li>
  <li>When cash is received, debit Cash. </li>
  <li>When cash is paid out, credit Cash. </li>
  <li>To increase an asset, debit the asset account. </li>
  <li>To increase a liability, credit the liability account. </li>
  <li>To increase equity, credit an equity account. </li>
  <li>To increase revenues, credit the revenues account </li>
  <li>To increase expenses, debit the expense account</li>
</ul>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The transactions in this system use the double entry accounting method. Under
  the double entry system every transaction is recorded in at least two accounts,
  thus the <em>double entry </em>. One account will receive a &quot;debit&quot; entry,
  meaning the amount will be entered on the left side of that account. Another account
  will receive a &quot;credit&quot; entry,
  meaning the amount will be entered on the right side of that account. The initial
  challenge with double entry is to know which account should be debited and which
account should be credited; a guide at the bottom of the 增加筆數 page will help you.</p>
<p>For example, when a company borrows $1,000 from a bank, the transaction will affect
  company's <em>Cash</em> account and the company's <em>Notes Payable</em> account. When the company
repays the bank loan, the <em>Cash</em> account and the <em>Notes
Payable</em> account are also involved. </p>
<p>If a company buys supplies for cash, its <em>Supplies</em> account and its <em>Cash</em> account
  will be affected. If the company buys supplies on credit, the accounts involved
  are <em>Supplies</em> and <em>Accounts Payable</em>.</p>
<p>Although the system is referred to as double entry, a transaction may involve
  more than two accounts. An example of a transaction that involves three accounts
  is a company's loan payment to its bank of $300. This transaction will involve
the following accounts: <em>Cash</em>, <em>Notes Payable</em>, and <em>Interest
Expense</em>.</p>
<h3>Debits and Credits</h3>
<p>After you have identified the two or more accounts involved in a business transaction,
you must debit at least one account and credit at least one account. </p>
<p>To debit an account means to enter an amount on the left side of the account.
  To credit an account means to enter an amount on the right side of an account. </p>
<p>Generally these types of accounts are increased with a debit:
</p><ul><li>Expenses </li>
  <li>Assets </li>
  <li>Losses </li>
</ul>
<p>Generally these types of accounts are increased with a credit:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gains </li>
  <li>Income </li>
  <li>Revenues </li>
  <li>Liabilities </li>
  <li> Equity </li>
</ul>
<p>To decrease an account you do the opposite of what was done to increase the account.
  For example, an asset account is increased with a debit. Therefore it is decreased
with a credit.</p>
<h3>Permanent and Temporary Accounts</h3>
<p>Asset, liability, and most owner/stockholder equity accounts are referred to as &quot;permanent
  accounts&quot; (or &quot;real accounts&quot;). Permanent accounts are not closed
  at the end of the accounting year; their balances are automatically carried forward
to the next accounting year. </p>
<p>&quot;Temporary accounts&quot; (or &quot;nominal accounts&quot;) include all of
  the revenue accounts, expense accounts, the owner drawing account, and the income
  summary account. Generally speaking, the balances in temporary accounts increase
  throughout the accounting year and are &quot;zeroed out&quot; and closed at the
  end of the accounting year. </p>
<p>Balances in the revenue and expense accounts are zeroed out by closing/transferring/clearing
  their balances to the Income Summary account. The net amount in Income Summary
  is then closed/transferred/cleared to an owner equity account, such as Mary Smith,
  Capital (or to Retained Earnings if the company is a corporation). The owner drawing
  account (such as Mary Smith, Drawing) is a temporary account and it is closed directly
  to the owner capital account (such as Mary Smith, Capital) without going through
  an income summary account. </p>
<p>Because the balances in the temporary accounts are transferred out of their respective
  accounts at the end of the accounting year, each temporary account will have a
  zero balance when the next accounting year begins. This means that the new accounting
  year starts with no revenue amounts, no expense amounts, and no amount in the drawing
  account. </p>
<p>By using many revenue accounts and a huge number of expense accounts, a company
  is certain to have easy access to detailed information on revenues and expenses
  throughout the year. This allows the management of the company to monitor the performance
  of all parts of the company. Once the accounting year has ended, the need to know
  the balances in these temporary accounts has also ended, so the accounts are closed
  out and reopened for the next accounting year with zero balances. </p>
