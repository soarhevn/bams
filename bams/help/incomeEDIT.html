<p>Edit the dues for this member. CAREFUL - changing an amount after it has been
  paid will change the monthly income total!</p>
<ul>
  <li>Month: only use this if member is paying by month and not every six months.</li>
  <li>Dues amounts: do not use commas when entering the amounts.</li>
  <li>Wire: if dues were wired in, select the account the dues were wired into. This
    will allow the system to calculate how much money to transfer to each account
    for wired dues at the end of each month. </li>
</ul>
<h3>New Member Entry Dues </h3>
<p>IMPORTANT: Marking dues as paid on this page will not show the new member entry
  dues as paid also! You must add a transaction under 其它事務處理 and manually log the
  amount paid from 經常會費 account receivable to the selected bank account it was paid
  into. </p>
